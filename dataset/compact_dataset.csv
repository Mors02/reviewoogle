10,Counter-Strike,"This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP. And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always, GL &amp; HF &lt;3",1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.  In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).",1,1

The several game modes and different custom maps can cool you down after losing a game that you really should have won. The pace and complexity of this game make it naturally unfriendly for beginners, but if you're a competitive guy who wants to prove himself, this game gives you an opportunity to mess with the best. You'll spend many hours on this game if you're serious about it, so be careful.",1,1

RIP  They also tweak the wrong things to make it more playable... Don't ban cheaters nearly enough... and pretty much allow aim assisst to ruin the game for MKB players who have to fight against controller auto lock. GG COD GG,-1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Great visuals, even if the game is hardly well optimized considering the performance issues even with high end systems. But this title spends half the time in some cinematically driven LSD mind trip. Which for a short, 8 hour long campaign in a war game, leaves very little of any actual war game content. That, and some of the bonus content that just makes one go 'WTF?' should've been avoided, and this game could've been so much more.",-1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Zombies is fun and challenging and you can spend hours upon hours on without boredum, although I can't say the same for Campaign and Multiplayer..abismal.    Campaign has no understandable/enjoyable storyline. There's so much robots and time travel it's ridiculous to follow, and say goodbye to memorable characters like the nostalgic cod 4/cod 5 campaigns had.    Multiplayer..don't get me started, if you're a zombie player most likely you can be slightly below average in multiplayer. For some reason if you're in a zombie lobby and look at the combat record of the players they've played extended amounts of both zombie and multiplayer mode but more so zombies, however if you're in a multiplayer lobby mostly all of the players have never even attempted zombies for some reason, I think mainly because if you want to be a multiplayer type you have to exclusively play just multiplayer, as it's so different from zombies, much faster pace means faster reaction time and is more challenging in general than zombies cough unbalanced weapons cough, multiplayer is rage fuel and zombies is happy fuel.  P.s plez Treyarch I want boots to the ground.",1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"My Review will be based on the multiplayer gameplay as most people buy the game for this purpose:  Pros: - New movement mechanics (smooth flowing and unobtrusive) not as insane as AW - Specialist characters add and a new refreshing layer to gameplay - Mostly foot on ground combat which fans have been requesting for - Kill-streaks actually do work!  Cons: - Questionable connection at times  If you're a new to the franchise, I recommend buying the game and giving multiplayer a try....you'll probably love it.  If you're a a fan of black ops 1 and 2...this game is a mix of both with far better graphics!",1,0

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"I do recommend this game, it is very fun and there is permanent action. The campaign is fine, but nothing special. But do not, i repeat, DO NOT buy any of the dlc unless you're a zombies fan. The multiplayer dlc maps have basically no players and you can't even choose the gamemode for them. The dlc supply drops are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but luckily there are mostly only cosmetics and very few guns in them.",1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Its okay, I'll recommend this game but only because its better than anything that's come out of the cod franchise in a few years, it's kinda fun but honestly if you're looking for a first person shooter that you can just jump into and have a bit of fun I would recommend you pick up Titanfall instead, you can get it and all its DLC for very cheap now and in my opinion it is actually much more fun than this game and isn't a huge grind like this game is.",1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"A very typical high-paced Call of Duty Black Ops game, with kills still satisfying and now with added walljumping. Audio is crisper than ever and visuals are prettier. I am concerned with the performance of this game however and how it performs on default setup, especially with mouse lag.  Lag is pretty bad on default and over an hour of tweaking is required to find a mix where you see the improved graphics, dodging mouse lag and still seeing the playable, stable FPS expected of CoD games. Right now I think Black Ops 2 is better value for the money, and is a far more refined game, however Black Ops 3 is definitely still fresh and enjoyable for anyone looking to shoot things.",1,0

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,Honestly thought it was going to be terrible.  Some hours in the free weekend now thinking about buying the game. Because it was actually very enjoyable. Not as good as bo1 was but still pretty good. There are some weapons that are way too over powered though.  6/10 multiplayer.,1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"For a moment, I thought that this game would be disliked, but I love it! You don't have to play Multiplayer, there's Campaign and Zombies, in which Campaign is my favorite one. Well, won't tell you why because reasons. x)  I definitely recommend this game, and (according to my country) is cheaper than buying a console version.",1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"People keep yelling that there is some sort of Texture-Lagg / Mouse-Lagg and some sort of other problems. I have had a very good game so far without any kind of problems.Although It is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you meet some lv 120 Aimbotters,because you ask yourself HOW did they reach such a HighLV without getting banned,all those Ragers and Flamers are some kind of a Pain in the ♥♥♥ as well,but as i said before,the game is pretty good!  But you should not buy any DLC except if you play much Zombies. Because almost no one is playing DLC maps.",1,0
311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Multiplayer; Pros: Like everything in a game or movie, there are things people don't like. Some people don't like this, others don't like that. That's where Black ops 3 comes in. People hated Ghost for many things such as slow movement and every gun was close to a 1 shot kill. Advanced Warfare was hated for the movement being too fast and most guns being clearly weaker than others. Black ops 3 has a mostly boots on the ground gameplay with some jumping in the air, but that is limited and takes time to recharge. Black ops 3 took Ghost and AW, combined the bad things and made something good out of it.  Cons: There are still bad things though such as the supply drop which people dislike because of the low chances of getting something like a weapon.  Campaign; Pros: 4 player co-op. Cons: No one plays campaign co-op. Zombies; Pros: Allows custom Guns to be made and Gobblegum that help your playstyle. Shadows of Evil is good if you set up right. Cons: The DLC maps are better that Shadows of Evil.  Game would get a solid 8/10",1,0

238960,Path of Exile,"My Rating: 8/10 Do I recommend it? Yes!  Firstly, it's an obvious Diablo II clone. That said, I ♥♥♥♥ing loved Diablo II, and I love Path of Exile about as much if not more. The graphics are a pleasure to enjoy for an isometric POV; the game mechanics are wonderful if a bit buggy at times (close quarters spellcasting sometimes fails to injure the baddies, or maybe I'm an idiot :P); I LOOOOVE the new potion mechanics (killing baddies refills the potions, rather than having umpteen billion potions in your inventory); the skill 'tree' is phenomenal and allows a wonderfully unique approach every play; the skill gems are also a unique approach to character abilities, in ways that don't lock abilities to certain classes.  The game is FREE TO PLAY! There is a microtransaction shop in game that can be linked to your Steam Wallet (which is handy) but it is basically all cosmetics for sale, nothing that I can find that affects your in game ability aside from perhaps an enhanced stash capacity.",1,0

Everything you could want from a dungeon crawler and more.  Thousands of items to collect and hundreds of weapons to slay even the toughest of foes. Choose from six different classes and build them however you desire. With a skill tree system with 100's of skills to choose from, the class builds are endless!  Are you a lone wolf, or do you like the idea of taking on that over-powered boss with a party of friends?
